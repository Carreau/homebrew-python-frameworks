# homebrew-python-frameworks

homebrew casks for Python.org framework installers

The official homebrew-cask decided to remove all of its Python installers,
so I copied them here.

Each Python version is named `python-framework-xy`

For example:

    brew tap minrk/homebrew-python-frameworks
    brew cask install python-framework-36
